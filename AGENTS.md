## Development tips

* Ignore TODO.md - this file only for himan developer


## Development notes

* before run "cargo check@ format code wuth run "rustfmt"
* always run "cargo check" before said to me that you finish work
* if "cargo check" find errors and warnings - fix it.
* never try to change version of "ice" and "iced_aw" in Cargo.toml, they are pinned. You may add "features" option or some thing else, but not versions. The project strongly used only that versions of these libraries. Other libraries you can change.
